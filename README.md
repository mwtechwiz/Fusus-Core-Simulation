# Fusus-Core-Simulation
This lab simulates a simplified FususCORE environment using Linux command-line tools. It helps demonstrate my technical support and networking skills relevant to roles involving camera systems, video streams, and Linux-based troubleshooting like those at Axon (Fusus).

## Objectives

- Simulate a mock video feed using FFmpeg
- Monitor system health with a Bash script
- Troubleshoot common network or process issues
- Document real-world errors and how to resolve them

---

## Tools Used

- ffmpeg – simulate video stream
- bash – automation and monitoring scripts
- curl – test endpoints
- ss / netstat – check open ports
- iproute2 – interface and routing
- tcpdump – traffic inspection
- Git & GitHub – version control and publishing

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install required tools

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git curl net-tools iputils-ping iproute2 tcpdump ffmpeg nginx dos2unix
